haskell-2048
============
A client server implementation of the 2048 game in Haskell, written with the goal of learning Haskell as I go...

The Game Logic and structures for 2048 are ported from the excellent Elm version written in Elm by ScrambledEggsOnToast here:

https://github.com/ScrambledEggsOnToast/2048-elm

All credit goes to him, I've only ported it (probably badly!) to my version. 

The rest of the code is probably mostly mine, sculpted from days of hard web searching and head scratching while I learn Haskell.
